Consistency: use camelCase - bitpattern uses _ style

Wifi: yes, implement server allowing easy change of internet router details. 
Then also implement client mode, so we can connect to internet and get date, time, weather etc.
 - Can we run in server AND client mode??
 - Set alarm: app sends http request to server, but we don't want to have to change wifi settings.
   So put script on amju.com, clock polls it, or when we click button on clock.

State pattern

Display: 
 - Time in fixed width format
 - Push button to 
    - snooze or stop alarm if it's on (long press to turn off, short press to snooze)
    - if no alarm, change mode to scrolling display, showing
       - date
       - time
       - alarm time, on or off
       - weather: can use Met Office Datapoint
       - current temp
    

    - update/set alarm: poll server when button clicked

Multiple buttons? Depends how many IO pins are left on ESP board.
3 buttons: prev/next/select? Have the buttons on top?
Slide switch for alarm on/off?
